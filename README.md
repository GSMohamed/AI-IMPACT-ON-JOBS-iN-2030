Chart title: AI Exposure, 2030 Automation Probability & Pay

Columns used:

X-axis: Average_AI_Exposure_Index

Y-axis: Average_Automation_Probability_2030

Details / Legend: Job_Title (each diamond represents a job)

Size (optional in your chart): Average_Salary, to show pay level for each job.

Caption under the chart:
This scatter plot maps each job by how much it is exposed to AI (horizontal axis) and how likely it is to be automated by 2030 (vertical axis). Jobs plotted further to the right and higher up are both more AI‑intensive and at greater automation risk, while the marker size reflects their average salary, helping compare which high‑risk roles are also high‑paying.






Chart title: Avg. of Automation Probability 2030 by Risk Category

Columns used:

Category (Y-axis): Risk_Category (Low, Medium, High)

Value (X-axis): Average_Automation_Probability_2030 (aggregation: Average for each category)
 
This bar chart compares the average probability of automation in 2030 across the three risk categories. Jobs in the High‑risk group show the highest automation probability (around 0.83), Medium‑risk jobs sit near 0.50, and Low‑risk roles are close to 0.18, clearly highlighting how much more exposed High‑risk occupations are to future automation.
